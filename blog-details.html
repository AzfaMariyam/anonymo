                <p>Every organization’s goal is to run smoothly, satisfying their customers, employees, and  other  stakeholders  equally.  But  the  possibility  of this  happening  is  extremely low, as mistakes can be made. In the co-operate environment there would always be issues,  it  may  be  related  to  employee  salaries,  complaints  regarding  managers  or colleagues  or  even  major  issues  employees  face  such  as  workplace harassment  or complaints  related  to  frauds,  mismanagement  of  company  funds  or  anytype  of malpractice in a company. </p> 
                <p>These  may  affect  the  progress  of  smooth-running  companies,  and  major  issues  may ruin  the  public  image  the  company  has  built.  For  this  reason,  call  lines  are implemented  to  make  complaints,  but  employees  or  the  public  do not  tend  to  use them  in  fear  of  being  identified.  Long  waiting  times  discourage  callers  from contacting   them   and   even   when   complaints   are   made,   they   are   not   handled immediately or are transferred to irrelevant departments. “Anonymo” addresses these issues,giving a proper solution to the callers and the company, allowing the callers to be  anonymous  and  minimizing  the  contact  with  a  human  agent,  and  analyzing complaints and transferring them to relevant departments, identifying the urgency of a  caller  as  well  as  detecting  fake  and  real  complaints  that  are  made,  with  the  aid  of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing.</p>
                <p>In this study, we implemented Anonymo, a system that includes a Conversational AI agent, Wanted and Unwanted call classification, Department-based Complaint classification, Caller Emotion detection and caller complaint analysis while establishing the caller’s anonymity. </p>

                <p>The currently existing Complaint Management Systems that involve caller complains
                  do not retain the anonymity of the caller, and due to this, employees or other 
                  stakeholders are reluctant to come forward and share the issue – may it be a fraud, a 
                  bribe, a harassment issue – with the company. These can ultimately lead to the 
                  downfall of organizations and ruin the public image they had created so far. 
                  Organizations prefer to deal with these complaints as soon as possible, to prevent any 
                  major problems. </p> 
              <p>A survey conducted with 253 people showed that the organization they work in has 
                  implemented a caller hotline where employees can make complains. A notable 
                  number is also unaware of such a hotline, and with an effective system and with the 
                  proper awareness, organizations can improve.
                  </p>
              <p>Almost all of the participants in the survey have called an organization’s hotline 
                  number at least once to make a complain about a certain issue or service provided by 
                  them. This shows that people are willing to make calls to organizations to solve their 
                  issues. </p>

              <p>62.8% of the participants agreed that they were reluctant and afraid to make a 
                  complaint or report a fraud due to the fear of being identified. This may be because if 
                  the complaint is regarding a person of power within the organization, the caller can 
                  face harassment, receive threats or in certain extreme cases, even effect their lives. </p>

              <p>247 participants confirmed that they will be more confident to make complains or 
                  reveal frauds of an organization by calling their hotline if it was certain that their 
                  personal information will not be disclosed or is unidentifiable. </p>
              
              <p>With guaranteed caller anonymity, we can conclude that the rate of people coming 
                  forward to present their issues will increase. The demand for such a system is there in 
                  the general society as well as in organizations. With “Anonymo”, callers can have a 
                  confidence in being anonymous and with the help of the Conversational AI system, 
                  they will also have a very user friendly and safer experience than interaction with a 
                  human agent.</p>
              
              <p>If existing difficulties are not resolved, frauds that have occurred are not handled, and 
                  wrongdoers are not brought to justice, no company can grow. In order to do so, 
                  management must be aware of the company's problems. All issues are currently 
                  directed to one department, and a human contact is required to manually sift through 
                  these issues and determine the appropriate person to whom they should be directed.
                  The bulk of complaints were sent to a number of different 
                  departments rather than the proper department. Some firm hotlines allow callers to 
                  choose the appropriate department right away. However, a typical person was not 
                  always able to guess which department should handle the complaint. This is a time consuming operation that wastes both human and material resources. If this 
                  classification is not done in real-time, it will not be a user-friendly solution because 
                  the complainant will have to track the progress of the complaint. If we can create a 
                  system that can create critical visualizations after an in-depth study to discover any 
                  trends in the complaints received, the appropriate department will be notified, and the 
                  business will be able to make the best decisions possible. This will allow the 
                  company to be notified even before an issue arises, providing a heads-up when any 
                  anomalies are discovered. 
                  </p>

                <h5>Conversational AI Agent</h5>
                <p>As discussed in the above literature review, a notable gap can be seen in the existing 
                  systems. A Conversational AI-based system that is suitable to handle anonymous 
                  caller complaints is not available, hance increasing the need for such a system in the 
                  market. As in one the systems, the system proposed does not handle complaints made through 
                  calls, even though it handles complaints efficiently. The applications also do not 
                  consider the anonymity of the caller, which is one major drawback of the system.  </p> 
                <p>The system developed with the aid of IBM Watson is also effective, but the 
                  accuracy is 76.5% which can be improved. The system uses many APIs for 
                  classification, conversion of Speech-to-Text and such but the user’s confidentiality is 
                  not taken into consideration. This system does not directly involve with calls but 
                  handles voice responses similar to calls. </p>
                <p>With only a few Conversational AI related research available, one notable system is 
                  the Artificial Intelligence Conversational Robot (AIARC). It identifies the 
                  emotion of the conversation while structuring a response. This system looks very 
                  promising, but the conclusion of the research paper notes that the formation of 
                  sentences should be improved. </p>
                <p>The chatbot based for hotels and the tourism industry is currently being 
                  implemented in the industry but is only focused to one area. It has many limitations 
                  when the user’s intentions slightly deviate from issues related to tourism. This model 
                  also does not handle anonymity well. </p>

                  <br>
                  <h5>Unwanted and Wanted Complaints Analysis and Visualization   </h5>
                <p>As mentioned in the literature review, there is a significant gap in the present 
                  systems. There is currently no IVR or Conversational AI-based system that can 
                  manage anonymous caller complaints, necessitating the development of such a 
                  system in the market. The proposed system, like does not handle complaints 
                  received via phone calls, despite the fact that it handles complaints efficiently. The 
                  programs also ignore the caller's anonymity, which is one of the system's biggest 
                  flaws. </p> 
                <p>The method created using IBM Watson is equally effective, but its accuracy is 
                  only 76.5 %, which should be improved. The system makes extensive use of APIs for 
                  classification, speech-to-text conversion, and other functions; however, the user's 
                  privacy is ignored. This system does not deal with calls directly, but it does deal with 
                  voice answers in the same way that it deals with calls. </p>
              
                  <br>
                  <h5>Complaint Classification based on Departments and Visualization   </h5>
                <p>It is clear, although earlier studies have 
                  been done in this area, none has used both complaint classifications by relevant 
                  departments and future possible complaint forecasts with visualizations through in depth analysis, with the goal of boosting accuracy and efficiency in real-time 
                  applications.
                   </p> 
                <p>The solutions are listed below under the “Complaint Classification based on 
                  Departments and Visualization” component of the Anonymo System. </p>
                  
                    <ul>
                      <li>Real time data analysis.</li>
                    <li>Classification according to the relevant department.</li> 
                    <li>Identify trends in complaints made.</li> 
                    <li>Visualize the frequency of complaints and other analyses.</li> 
                  </ul>
                
                  <br>
                  <h5>Speech Emotion Recognition and Prioritizing Complaints   </h5>
                <p>Previously described studies were mainly focused on Emotion Recognition models 
                  but there was no method of developing the model to identify urgent messages. 
                  Models were developed to identify emotions specifically but some of them showed
                  model accuracies which are in lower ranges.
                   </p> 
                <p>As a solution the model which was developed for “Anonymo” can manage calls and 
                  preserve its anonymity, identify voice tone and according to the tone it can identify 
                  the emotions. Finally, the system prioritizes the messages which are identified as 
                  urgent </p>

          <p>The aim of this research is to provide stakeholders of organizations- that includes employees and customers a solution
             to provide their complaints, issues and inform the organization of any other malpractices without the fear of being identified,
              as well as prioritize the received complaints so that solutions will be provided as soon as possible. The Anonymo system also focuses on 
              minimizing the hassle that organizations face in managing complaints by analyzing the received complaints and routing them to relevant departments 
              and also classifying necessary and unwanted complaints that may block or hinder the hotline setup by the organization. A survey was initially conducted for
               the purpose of identifying the pain points a caller and the organization faces when using a whistleblower or complaint management hotline. 
               In order to provide a more accurate solution, the research focuses on Banking and financial institutions and the data collected for analysis of 
               departments and to build the Conversational AI agent are complaints related to these areas.</p>

          <h5>Conversational AI Agent</h5>
          <p>The Conversational AI agent focuses on responding to the customer queries and provide appropriate responses. This is in the aim of reducing human 
            interaction with the caller so that the caller will have no fear of being identified. The data obtained were complaints made by users related to a Bank. 
            The data was first categorized into various intents depending on the intention of the phrases uttered by the callers. Each intent consists of a tag - to identify 
            the intention of the phrase, patterns – phrases that callers use to communicate their needs relevant to the intent, 
            and responses – the response the Conversational AI agent needs to provide to the caller.  </p> 
          <p>Common intents are given tags such as ‘greeting’, ‘goodbye’ and ‘thanks’, and intents are also available regarding the type or category of the complaint or
             conversation like ‘makecomplaint’, ‘studentloans’, ‘creditcard’ and such. An example for a pattern under the intent of ‘greeting’ is ‘Hello’ or ‘Hi there’, and 
             a response would be ‘Hello, I’m Anonymo, how may I help you today?’. Google Speech Recognition API is used to convert the spoken voice of the caller to written 
             text to identify the speaker’s utterances. Natural Language Toolkit is as well as various keras and tensorflow libraries are used for preprocessing as well 
            as model building and model optimization purposes. </p>

            <br>
            <h5>Unwanted and Wanted Complaints Analysis and Visualization   </h5>
          <p>A text-based dataset including 1 million complaints was utilized to train the unwanted/wanted complaints detection algorithm. Text-based complaints are classified as unwanted or wanted, with the categorization term labeled on the text-based complaints. The dataset consits of approximately 80 percent of complaints that are wanted, while 20 percent are labeled as unwanted. </p> 
          <p>TThe dataset is in the form of a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. There are 16 columns of text-based complaints and nearly 1 million rows. The data collection was cleansed of these unnecessary columns for feature selection. Rows and columns containing null data were removed at the preprocessing stage. Following pre-processing of the collected data, the ”Issue” column was identified as an independent variable at the time, and the ”UnwantedorNot” column was identified as a dependent variable. Using Natural Language Processing the datasets have been cleaned such as removing any special characters, html tags, etc. Then the corpus was tokenized and applied Normalization, stemming, Lemmatization for the tokens in order to reduce the term vocabulary and removed stop words from tokenized text. Finally converted the tokens into TF-IDF weights then normalized the term vectors. The training set, which is a list of labelled complaints, was generated as the second stage. 75% of the training set and 25% of the testing set were separated.</p>
        
            <br>
            <h5>Complaint Classification based on Departments and Visualization   </h5>
          <p>A text-based data set containing financial institution complaints was used to build models for classification of complaints according to departments. The seven departments that received complaints were the Debt Department, Mortgage Department, Accounts Department, Credit Reporting Department, Transaction and Foreign-Currency-Exchange Department, Loan Department, and Cards Department.
             </p> 
          <p>Outliers or unusual occurrences in a dataset can affect the accuracy of models. As a result, an exploratory analysis was carried out in order to identify abnormalities, trends, and summarize the main characteristics of the dataset before modeling. </p>
            
              <p>During the preprocessing in classification of complaints according to the departments, all the punctuation marks, digits, stop words has been removed from the complaint narration as they don’t have any prediction powers. After tokenization the row complaint narration broken to tokens. Using Natural Language Process techniques such as stemming, and lemmatization determined the root form of each token. To convert tokens into real numbers TF-IDF vectorization method was used. Following the split of the data set into training and testing sets, several machine learning models were trained for complaint classification based on departments. Used supervised learning algorithms for model building. The machine learning models were built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multinomial Na¨ıve Bayes (MNB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) algorithms. Using the testing set, all of the models were tested.</p>
          
            <br>
            <h5>Speech Emotion Recognition and Prioritizing Complaints   </h5>
          <p>Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS), an acted audio dataset which is created with the purpose of analyze the impact of age on emotional recognition was selected for Emotion recognition and detection. The dataset consists of two female actors around the age of 20 and 60. Each actor imitated seven emotions for 200 ordinary sentences. Altogether dataset contains 2800 of audio clips, 400 clips for each emotions.The seven emotions are categorized as Angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, surprise and sad.
             </p> 
          <p>As the first step, the emotion name was split from the voice clip’s name and created a dataframe using the audio clip and the emotion name. Generally, speech signals are contaminated by noise. To increase signal quality and output accuracy, speech data must be prepared to reduce or eliminate these disturbances. Although there is no noise to reduce from the used audio clips, it was done to validate the data. Audio clips were trimmed and Right-side padding for length equalization was performed. </p>
          <p>Exploratory data analysis was conducted and the differences between each emotion and the amplitude and with the time was identified. Spectrograms and waveplots emphasize the specific characteristics for the different emotions. Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC), also known as the ”spectrum of a spectrum,” is the only characteristic used to train the model. It is a widely using technique for the feature extraction of the audio signals. Basically, MFCC is used to convert audio files to numerical format. Along with its capacity to describe the amplitude spectrum of an acoustic source in a compact vectorial form, the MFCC has been commonly applied. 40 acoustic features were extracted from the preprocessed audio clips.</p>

          <h5>Main objectives</h5>
          <p>One of the main objectives of the Anonymo system is to provide a secure method for 
          callers, may it be employees, clients, or outside parties to make complaints or present 
          issues to the organization without revealing their anonymity. The Anonymo system 
          will replace the human call center agent and would communicate with the caller 
          instead. The Anonymo system also stores the caller complaints and redirect them to 
          relevant department after necessary Data Analysis. Fake and real calls and 
          complaints are also identified to increase the efficiency and handle only legitimate 
          complaints. The Anonymo system also focuses on providing the customer the best 
          caller experience by prioritizing the calls based on the urgency of the tone of the 
          caller.   </p>
